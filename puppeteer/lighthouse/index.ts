/**
 * Custom network throttling for Lighthouse Testing using Puppeteer.
 *
 * Chrome gets launched by Puppeteer (normally done by LH) and custom network
 * conditions are established through Puppeteer's APIs. Lighthouse then audits
 * the page with those settings.
 *
 * The flow is:
 * 1. Disable Lighthouse's default throttling settings.
 * 2. Launch Chrome using Puppeteer. Tell Lighthouse to reuse that chrome
 *    instance instead of launching it's own.
 * 3. Hand the url to Lighthouse for testing.
 * Puppeteer observes the page opening, then sets up emulation.
